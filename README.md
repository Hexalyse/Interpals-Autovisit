InterpalsAutoVisit
============

** This script is very old and not working anymore. For a more elaborate and up-to-date script dealing with Interpals search feature, please see https://github.com/anonimousse12345/qtcreeper


This script connects to your Interpals account (penpal website), then fetch the "online users" page with the filters you provide, and visit the profile of those users. Thus, you will get back-visit from people, and maybe messages... without the hassle of searching for interesting people yourself.
